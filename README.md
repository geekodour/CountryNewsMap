# NewsMap - News By Country

A simple webapp that uses very basic sentiment analysis on News Headlines to determine the Happiness of a country in near realtime (not sure if that's the perfect way to describe it)

# Todo
- Implement a seperate page for news with links to news for every country where user can search
- Fix firefox loading issue, some very bad code executes geo charts long enough for firefox to block the script and ask the user if they want to continue. (Need to fix this asap) See Issues for more firefox isues.
